#### A "What's New" Screen, with a few tricks up it's sleeve.

### What’s New? Nm, what’s new witchu?

- **Flexible release history**: Unlike most What's New Screen libraries, Recap can display multiple releases, showcasing your app's entire feature history.

- **No code, no problems**: Powered by a simple Markdown file, stored locally or loaded remotely.

- **Built-in customization**: Presents a beautiful, standardized interface out of the box, while offering full customization to match any app's design language.

- **Semantic versioning support**: Simple logic to help decide when to display your What's New Screen.

### Getting Started

Setting up a screen to display your app's releases is simple:
1. Create a markdown file with your releases (we'll cover the format later).
2. Add two lines of code.

```swift
// Initialize releases from a markdown file in your app's bundle
extension [Release] {
    static var appReleases: [Release] {
        ReleasesParser(fileName: "Releases").releases
    }
}

// Create and display the RecapScreen
RecapScreen(releases: .appReleases)
```

That's all you need to get started!

### Creating Releases

Your releases are defined in a simple markdown file, with a very simple spec:
```markdown
# Version Number: [String] (Supports arbitrary number formats such as 1, 1.0, or 1.0.0)
## Release Title: [String]
### Semantic Version Change Type: [Major | Minor | Patch]

- title: [String] (Feature Title)
- description: [String] (Feature Description)
- symbol: [String] (SF Symbol Identifier)
- color: [String] (Hex Color Code or System Color Name)
```

> [!NOTE]
> For a full list of supported System Color Names, see `Sources/Recap/Internal/Color+SystemNames.swift`.

#### Example Releases file

```markdown
# 1.1
## New Features ❤️
### Minor

- title: Super Cool Feature #1
- description: You won't believe how this works
- symbol: sparkles
- color: cyan

- title: Super Cool Feature #2
- description: You will believe how this one works though
- symbol: text.magnifyingglass
- color: blue

- title: Super Cool Feature #3
- description: This feature is for the nerds in the house
- symbol: apple.terminal.on.rectangle
- color: orange

# 1.0.1
## Bug Fixes! 🐛
### Patch

- title: Welcome to some bug fixes!
- description: My bad y'all…
- symbol: ladybug.circle
- color: #FFC933

# 1.0
## Introducing Recap 🥳
### Major

- title: Welcome to Recap
- description: It's live! 🥰
- symbol: party.popper
- color: #F72585
```

With just a few lines of markdown we've built a Releases screen that has three pages, with a consistent look and feel.

### Customize Your Release Screen

Recap provides various modifiers to tailor the Releases screen to your app's visual identity:

```swift
// Available customization modifiers
func recapScreenStartIndex(_ startIndex: RecapScreenStartIndex) -> some View
func recapScreenTitleStyle(_ style: some ShapeStyle) -> some View
func recapScreenDismissButtonStyle(_ style: some ShapeStyle) -> some View
func recapScreenDismissButtonStyle(_ backgroundStyle: some ShapeStyle, _ foregroundStyle: some ShapeStyle) -> some View
func recapScreenDismissButtonTitle(_ title: LocalizedStringResource) -> some View
func recapScreenIconFillMode(_ style: IconFillMode) -> some View
func recapScreenIconAlignment(_ alignment: VerticalAlignment) -> some View
func recapScreenPageIndicatorColors(selected: Color, deselected: Color) -> some View
func recapScreenBackground(_ style: AnyShapeStyle?) -> some View
func recapScreenBackground(_ color: Color) -> some View
func recapScreenPadding(_ insets: EdgeInsets) -> some View
func recapScreenHeaderSpacing(_ spacing: CGFloat) -> some View
func recapScreenItemSpacing(_ spacing: CGFloat) -> some View
func recapScreenDismissAction(_ dismissAction: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
```

Example usage:

```swift
RecapScreen(releases: .appReleases)
    .recapScreenTitleStyle(LinearGradient(colors: [.purple, .pink, .orange, .yellow], startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing))
    .recapScreenDismissButtonStyle(Color.pink, Color.white)
    .recapScreenIconFillMode(.gradient)
    .recapScreenPageIndicatorColors(
        selected: Color.pink,
        deselected: Color.gray
    )
```

RecapScreen also supports leading and trailing views:

```swift
RecapScreen(
    releases: .plinkyReleases
    leadingView: {
        UpcomingRoadmapView()
    }, trailingView: {
        SupportView()
    }
)
.recapScreenStartIndex(.release())
// Alternatively: .recapScreenStartIndex(.leadingView) or .recapScreenStartIndex(.trailingView)
```

In my app [Plinky](https://plinky.app), I use the leading view to display the app's upcoming roadmap ahead of the most recent features, and the trailing view displays a support screen for people to reach out to me after browsing the feature list.

### Semantic Versioning

Recap includes a `SemanticVersion` type, to help determine when to display the What's New Screen. Here's an example of how to use it:

Recap bundles a useful utility for choosing when to display the What's New Screen. You can use `SemanticVersion` to compare your app's current version to the last launched version, to decide if you should show the What's New Screen. I recommend tailoring the logic to your needs, but this is a basic example of how it can be used.

```swift
var shouldDisplayRecapScreen: Bool {
    let currentVersionString = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "CFBundleShortVersionString") as? String
    let previousVersionString = "1.0.0" // You should decide the best way to store the user's last launched version number, UserDefaults is a useful option.

    guard let currentVersionString else { return false }
    guard let previousVersionString else { return false }

    let currentVersion = SemanticVersion(version: currentVersionString)
    let previousVersion = SemanticVersion(version: previousVersionString)

    // Show screen if major or minor version has increased
    return currentVersion.major > previousVersion.major || currentVersion.minor > previousVersion.minor
}
```

This logic displays the RecapScreen when:
- Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
- But not when upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1

### Demo

Try Recap with [the demo project](https://github.com/mergesort/Recap/tree/main/Demo) to see if it fits your app's needs. 📱

### Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 14+

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the Swift build system.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Recap as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mergesort/Recap.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

#### Manually

If you prefer not to use SPM, you can integrate Recap into your project manually by copying the files in.
